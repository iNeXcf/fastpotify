Open MilkDrop from the top-bar visualiser button, Ctrl+Shift+K, Settings, or
the mini player's **V** menu. It uses
[projectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) to play `.milk`
presets in its own window and process.

MilkDrop is included in the Linux, macOS, and x86_64 Windows builds. The
Windows on ARM build leaves it out.

## The window

Drag the image to move the window. Double-click, **Alt+Enter**, or **F** enters
fullscreen. Press **Esc** to leave fullscreen or close the window. Drag the
lower-right corner to resize it.

MilkDrop uses the same post-equalizer, pre-volume audio as the other
visualisers. It keeps moving at zero volume and stays flat when another device
is playing.

## Presets

Presets change every ten seconds by default. Change the interval in Settings.
Presets live in the config directory's `milkdrop` folder. The first time
MilkDrop opens with an empty folder, Fastpotify automatically downloads the
550 MilkDrop 2 presets and the 9,800-preset Cream of the Crop pack. Settings
can fetch either pack again. Until the first preset arrives, projectM shows
its idle preset.

## Controls

- **N** or right arrow: next preset.
- **P** or left arrow: previous preset.
- **H**: switch on the next beat.
- **L**: keep the current preset.
- **R**: switch between random and folder order.
- **T**: show or hide the preset name.
- **D**: show or hide the frame rate.
- **I**: cycle the song display between a change notification, always visible,
  and hidden.
- **?** or **F1**: show all shortcuts.

The normal playback shortcuts also work.

**Single-key shortcuts** in Settings is on by default. Turning it off disables
all the single-key controls above, including **?** and **F1**, plus **F** and
the player keys **Space**, **M**, **B**, and **S**. Shift and capital letters
do not bypass the setting. It applies to open and newly opened MilkDrop windows.

**Ctrl/Command+Left/Right** still changes songs, **Ctrl/Command+Up/Down** still
adjusts volume, **Alt+Enter** still toggles fullscreen, and **Esc** still leaves
fullscreen or closes the window. Mouse controls are unchanged, including
right-click for the next preset and double-click for fullscreen.
